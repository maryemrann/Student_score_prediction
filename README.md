# Student Score Prediction

This project predicts student exam scores based on study hours and other performance-related features using regression models. It includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), linear regression, polynomial regression, and feature combination experiments.

## Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
  - Histograms for study hours and exam scores  
  - Correlation heatmap between numeric features

- **Regression Models**  
  - Linear Regression  
  - Polynomial Regression (degree=2)  
  - Feature combination experiments to find the best predictors

## Dataset

The project uses the [Student Performance Factors dataset](data/StudentPerformanceFactors.csv).  
Columns include:
- Hours Studied
- Sleep Hours
- Previous Scores
- Attendance
- Class Participation
- Performance Index (Exam Score)
